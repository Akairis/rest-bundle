LemonRestBundle
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stanlemon/rest-bundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stanlemon/rest-bundle)

This bundle provides REST endpoints for Doctrine entities. It is a highly opinionated, convention driven solution to rapidly deploying a REST API.  It relies on the strengths of libraries like [JMS Serializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer), [Will Durands Content Negotiation library](http://williamdurand.fr/Negotiation/) and the [Doctrine Object Relation Mapper library](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html) to make assumptions and drive your REST API off of convention.

If you are looking for an extremely flexible way to build REST APIs this library is not for you, and I suggest you take a look at the fantastic work being done on the [Friends of Symfony REST Bundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle).
